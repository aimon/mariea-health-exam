How is Maria Health’s method of loading pages better than the traditional method?

Answer:
MariaHealth uses AJAX and It Reduce the server traffic, 
It saves memory when the data is fetched from the same page, 
and faster retrieval of data.


How is it worse?

Answer:
Search engines cannot index an AJAX applications.
Too many handlings in slow and unreliable network connection.
JavaScript disabled browsers cannot use the application.


When should each be used over the other?

Answer:
In my opinion, each page must be loaded in the server, and we can use AJAX in a small part of
the application for example a search bar with an autocomplete or suggestion that fetched through the server.
